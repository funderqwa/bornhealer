              <h4>Stopped taking the Osteo Arthritis tablets</h4>
              <p>
                To whom it may concern I was diagnosed with severe disc disease
                (osteo arthritis) of the lower spine approximately six years
                ago. I experienced almost constant pain. I had to lever myself
                up with my arms when sitting in a lounge chair. Turning over in
                bed was painful, and I couldn’t stand for any length of time. I
                consulted two orthopaedic surgeons and also a rheumatologist.
                The only treatment they offered me was anti-inflammatory
                tablets, which upset my stomach. After seeing you a few times, I
                am now pain free. I have stopped taking the Osteo Arthritis
                tablets. I am able to go for long walks again. Thank you for
                giving me a better quality of life.

              <p>
                Dear Rosemarie As you know I have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for
                the last 10 years and medication was continually increased over
                the years. When I came to you in September this year I was in a
                lot of pain and was really miserable as I felt I was not
                improving. Since the healing, I have pain free days and much
                more movement in my joints. For that I thank you from the bottom
                of my heart.

                Dear Rosemarie I have still not met you being situated in Cape
                Town although I feel such a trust and togetherness towards you.
                Over so many years you have been such a gem. When I could not
                see the light ahead, you filled me with hope to carry on. With
                so many problems regarding the sale of my house you took my
                stress away and guided me in a different direction. Thank you
                for being there for me.

              <p>
                Dear Rosemarie Over the past 2 years I have been to quite a few
                vets regarding my horse “Barnt” who has a serious shoulder
                problem. He has been so miserable and walks with pain. I cannot
                ride him anymore. I was referred to you by a friend and was told
                that you were highly recommended. I did not believe in this
                miraculous healing but was willing to try anything. Since your
                healing I can now ride him again. Thank you, thank you.

              <p>
                I was diagnosed with Menier’s Disease three years ago. I would
                constantly get very dizzy and very nauseous and lose all sense
                of balance to the point where an extreme attack would last up to
                4 hours. I can only imagine that this is what it feels like to
                be dying! I truly thought my life was over. After your healing I
                am now able to cope with my life. Thank you for your incredible
                gift.

                Dear Rosemarie DISC DESICCATION I would like to thank you for
                taking away my pain. As you know I have been suffering with back
                pain for more than ten years. I have been to see lots of Doctors
                and Specialists. No one could fix me permanently. But after
                seeing you a few times, I am now able to live a normal life
                again. Thank you for changing my life.

              <h4>cleansing all this negativity</h4>
              <p>
                Dear Rosemary I have felt desolate in that beautiful house. My
                kitchen cupboards kept opening when I made sure the night before
                that they were closed. I even heard banging in the kitchen on a
                regular basis. What an uncomfortable feeling to have to deal
                with something I just could not understand. In the meantime I
                had to go overseas and was so worried. Since you cleansed all
                this negativity I am at peace.

              <p>
                Dear Rosemary, just a short note of thanks for all you have done
                for me, I still can’t believe what has happened in my life….over
                a period of 3 years I have had both my hips replaced and then
                unfortunately as a result of hitting a pot hole I had major back
                problems and was forced to see a neuro-surgeon who advised me
                that I needed to have a spinal fusion. Having gone through so
                much pain and having heard what a back op entails I was
                reluctant to do so, and whilst being in hospital a friend of
                mine told me to contact you, I am still amazed at what has
                happened to me, I have made a full recovery, I am walking,
                driving my car and back at work.

                Dear Rosemarie My son of 11 years old was diagnosed with Autism.
                We knew something was wrong with him and went to several
                Specialists to find out what the problem was. Hyper is not even
                the right word for him as I need to watch him 24/7. His
                sympthoms were: no communication, could not compose himself, was
                very destructive, and had no fear for danger. After the spirit
                release I have now found my son whom I have lost 11 years ago.
                You are an earth Angel.

                Dear Rosemarie I was diagnosed with Herpes 11 about 3 years ago
                and realised that this disease is incurable. Being in love and
                trusting that very well-to-do man was to my detriment. I ended
                up with a nasty fever daily, have already lost 6 teeth, my gums
                are swollen with two of my teeth being loose. I can honestly say
                that my prayers have been answered since my healing I am so much
                better, I have now a life.

                Good Day Rosemarie My daughter has been diagnosed with “Delayed
                Motor Myotomes, lower limbs”. My little Princess just could not
                walk let alone take one step, furthermore she had by now lost a
                lot of confidence. I was referred to a massive hospital who
                dealt with that problem but was gripped by fear when I heard
                what she would have to undergo. After your healing she has now
                started walking. My husband and I feel that she has a special
                bond with you.

              <p>
                Dearest Rosemarie My young sister who was only 16 years old had
                committed suicide 3 months ago. I was very close to her but
                being a lot older than her I found my special love, got married
                and left home. I tried to help as much as I could but was always
                worried about her. After her death I felt a presence around me
                and was very worried as she told me that she would never leave
                me. During the reading you told me that I had an attachment
                which was my sister. I was shocked but after you spoke to her
                she told me that she will be going to the light now. That same
                evening I felt her departing my body.

                Dear Rosemarie How can I thank you for changing my son’s life
                who was attending a remedial school in Fourways. I was
                devastated to be forced to put him on medication but slowly
                decreased the dosage. From the time he was in his cot various
                ordeals happened in our house as we soon found out that our
                house was haunted. You cleansed my house and you did spirit
                release on my son who is a totally different child now. My son
                is now a happy boy and living a normal life thanks to you.

                Dear Rosemarie I am a 20 year old British Female who was
                involved in a car accident on the 16th April 1999. I was trapped
                inside the car, the Fire Brigade had to cut me out of the car. I
                suffered laserations to my arms and face, I had a cracked
                knee-cap as well as severe whiplash. The hospital fixed me up
                and I continued with my studies. The following year I had to see
                a Neurologist as I experienced severe headaches. For the past 11
                years I have been in and out of hospitals but nobody could tell
                me what was wrong. My last hope was you and now I am PAINFREE.

                Dear Rosemarie Thank you for coming to my house in Bassonia. My

                strangling her. My grand-daughter who has a toy which operates
                with batteries only started playing up in the middle of the
                night after I seriously removed all those batteries. Life became

                Dear Rosemarie What a pleasure it was meeting you. At least I
                regained hope for my horse “Lady Jane” after a brief chat to
                you. She hurt herself badly in her hoof with barbed wire. I felt
                so desperate specially that she is still a young and lively
                horse. The Vet did give her stitches but was unable to remove a
                piece of wire. I would like to thank you for healing my horse
                which now walks normally again. You are truly an Angel.
